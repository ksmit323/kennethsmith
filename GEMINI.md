# Project Context: Kenneth Smith Portfolio

## Overview
This is a personal portfolio website built with **Next.js 15+ (App Router)**, designed to showcase software development projects, particularly in the blockchain and full-stack domains. It features a modern, responsive design with dark mode support, smooth animations, and a contact form backend.

### Key Technologies
*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion
*   **Icons:** Lucide React
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (`app/api/`) with Nodemailer

## Architecture
*   **`app/`**: Contains the application routes and layout.
    *   `page.tsx`: The main landing page, composed of several sections (Hero, Projects, About, etc.).
    *   `layout.tsx`: Defines the root layout, including the `ThemeProvider` (next-themes) and global navbar/footer.
    *   `api/contact/route.ts`: API endpoint for handling contact form submissions via SMTP.
*   **`components/`**: React components.
    *   `ui/`: Reusable UI primitives (likely generated by shadcn/ui).
    *   Specific sections like `hero-section.tsx`, `project-card.tsx`, etc.
*   **`lib/`**: Utility functions and data.
    *   `projects.ts`: Contains the static data for the portfolio projects (no database used for content).
    *   `utils.ts`: Helper functions (likely `cn` for class merging).

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (LTS recommended)
*   npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Commands
*   **Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

*   **Start Production Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

*   **Linting:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

### Environment Variables
For the contact form to function, the following environment variables are required (create a `.env.local` file):
*   `SMTP_HOST`: Hostname of your SMTP server.
*   `SMTP_PORT`: Port for the SMTP server (usually 465 or 587).
*   `EMAIL_USER`: Username/email for authentication.
*   `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Password or app-specific password.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. For conditional class merging, use the `cn()` utility (typically found in `lib/utils.ts`).
*   **Components:** strictly typed React components (`FC` or function declarations).
*   **Icons:** Use `lucide-react` for iconography.
*   **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for complex transitions and entrance animations.
*   **Data:** Project data is currently static in `lib/projects.ts`. Modify this file to add/update portfolio items.
*   **Theme:** The app defaults to dark mode. Theme switching is handled by `next-themes` via `components/theme-provider.tsx`.
